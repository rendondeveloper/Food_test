# Project Title

I did this project to show some dishes very delicious to  getting from  [themealdb API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and show mi skills to create apps with flutter.

## Overview

This project was created with Clean architecture + the screamming architecture + bloc + repository + data source + injection of dependencies.
That concept was applied in project to build a great app with the option to escalate with more functionalities and testing.

Note 
I thought use interfaces to make data sources, repositories and use cases, but to optimize my time I used directly implementations.
